**c**o**R**anavirus **e**arly-**w**arning (**cRew**) App tracks Covid-19 / flu like disease symptoms in real-time. The goal of cRew is to map in real-time healthy and symptomatic people. As users enter data about their health status, the app monitors temporal and spatial changes and estimates sudden increases or decreases on local risks. **Experimental use only.**

User input parameters are based on health (fever, coughing, breathing problems), behavioral (such as going outside, staying home and wearing mask) and location based.

The app is built with [shinyMobile](https://rinterface.github.io/shinyMobile/) & [firebase](https://firebase.john-coene.com/), 
[echarts4r](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/) and [fireData]( https://github.com/Kohze/fireData)


## About

The app uses Google firebase authentication. This ensures that only authenticated users are able to interact with the app. Firebase authentication is established through the functions of [firebase R package](https://firebase.john-coene.com/) from John Coene. 

Other features include:

* User data are saved to Google **Firebase real-time database.**
  * as collections **in user-specific folders.** This is achieved through the use of variables created during the authentication.

Two variables are used:

* **uid**: The user ID, unique to the Firebase project. Generated during authentication. This is used to create a **user specific directory** in firebase database.
   
access uid in Shiny/firebase app by **f\$signed_in$response\$uid**
   
* **token**: The Token generated during user authentication 
   
access the token in Shiny/firebase app by **f\$signed_in\$response\$stsTokenManager\$accessToken**
    
Example: 

``` r
 fireData::upload(x = user_inputs, 
                projectURL = databaseURL,
                directory = paste0("fire/",uid()), # Combine your target directory with uid
                token=token())  # Add token information
```

The second part requires to correctly setup google firebase rules. [More information](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/quickstart?authuser=0). 

For example following rules allow only authenticated users to can read data and only save data under their user-specific folder in the database. 

``` r
# Example rules to specify that user data can be saved only at a user specific node
# in the database (here 'fire/uid' directory).

{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth.uid != null",
    ".write": false,
    "fire":{
      "$uid": {
        ".write": "auth.uid === $uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
* Users can access their past inputs from the My history tab.
* Server methods allows only authenticated users to see the plots (e.g. f$req_sign_in() needs to be TRUE)


## cRew App 

[cRew Tracker](http://tools.dataatomic.com/shiny/cRew) 

The app is for experimental purposes and the disease risk estimation via the app are calculated by the users who enter values thus can be biased.


``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("korur/cRew")
```


## How to run

The code for the app is available as an R package cRew. You can deploy and connect to your own database and run it with your modifications.

``` r
# Run the app
cRew::run_app()
```
